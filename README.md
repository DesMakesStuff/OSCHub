# OSCHub

OSCHub is an application that takes OSC messages from VRChat and forwards them to multiple applications. This resolves the issue of being unable to run multiple OSC applications due to port restrictions. OSCHub will relay any message it receives to all configured applications, and will save a list of those applications for ease of use on next runtime.

# OSC Debug Feature

OSCHub also includes an OSC debug feature for avatar parameters. Simply start the server and navigate to the Paramater Debug tab. There, all detected parameters will populate into a list which will display live values when selected.
